> # Blog-PERN
The Blog site is a small copy of Telegram and Instagram.  The creation of this application was driven by showing my knowledge in the following areas:

> ## Frontend:
- React with TypeScript
‌- Code splitting: React.memo, React.lazy
- Atomic design / atomic UI (the application is divided into pages. Pages - into organisms. Organisms - into molecules. Molecules - into molecules and/or atoms)
- Styled Components
- Dark and light themes
- Hooks: useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo, custom 
- Redux toolkit (asyncThunk, slice)
- React router dom
- JSON server styles (without CSS) 
- WebSocket chat
- Search field with denounce
- Change color of theme with throttling 
- Photo upload   

> ## Backend: 
- Node.js with TypeScript 
- Express
- Express validator
‌- Custom Error (HttpException)
- Middleware (error handler, check access and check activation)
- API CRUD with database: user, chat, comment, photo, post
‌- JWT
‌- CRUD with file system (fs, path)
- Code splitting: controller, service, path, types, DTO
- PostgreSQL with Sequelize 
- WebSocket  
- JSON server styles (tags and css variables)
- Upload photo, save it to database, resizing  
- Send message to email with a nodemailer
- Webpack
